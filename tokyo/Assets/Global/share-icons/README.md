# Share icons (curated)

This folder is a curated SVG set for Prague curated-embed share UI.

- **Functional glyphs** (`share.svg`, `copy.svg`, `sms.svg`, `email.svg`, `more.svg`) are copied from the Dieter icon set at `tokyo/dieter/icons/svg/`.
- **Brand marks** (e.g. `whatsapp.svg`, `telegram.svg`) are fetched as raw SVGs for design iteration.

Notes:
- Brand logos are trademarks of their respective owners. Keep usage minimal and consistent with each brand’s guidelines.
- These SVGs are intended to be normalized in Figma (size, viewBox, stroke/fill rules) before locking down.
