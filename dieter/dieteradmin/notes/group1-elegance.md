# Group 1 Elegance Checklist

- **System colors**: Link and Spinner rely solely on Dieter role tokens and color-mix helpers. No raw hex values remain.
- **Parallel usage**: Container, Divider, Link, and Spinner coexist without namespace clashes; selectors stay scoped under `.diet-*` roots.
- **Modern polish**: Hover/focus states mirror Dieter focus ring + Gestalt polish. Reduced motion fallbacks applied to animated components.
- **Gaps**: None identified for Group 1. No additional tokens required.
