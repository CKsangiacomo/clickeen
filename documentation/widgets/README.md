# Widget PRDs (Phase‑1)

STATUS: WIP — Per‑widget docs are being drafted. Widgets listed here are ONLY wired in Venice (SSR) and are not GA.

Location: One `.md` per widget under `documentation/widgets/`.

Current widgets (wired in Venice):

- forms.contact — documentation/widgets/forms.contact.md
- content.faq — documentation/widgets/content.faq.md
- social.testimonials — documentation/widgets/social.testimonials.md
- engagement.announcement — documentation/widgets/engagement.announcement.md
- engagement.newsletter — documentation/widgets/engagement.newsletter.md
- social.proof — documentation/widgets/social.proof.md

Notes
- These documents capture current Venice SSR status and stub configs only. Full PRDs (schemas, templates, UX states) will be completed before GA.
- For API contracts and schema definitions, refer to `documentation/systems/paris.md`, `documentation/systems/geneva.md`, and `supabase/migrations/`.
