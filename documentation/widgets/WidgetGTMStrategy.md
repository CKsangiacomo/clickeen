# Widget GTM Strategy Template

**Purpose:** Teach AI how to market a widget by starting with benefits, then deriving all content from them.

---

## Part 1: Clickeen Platform Benefits (Universal to All Widgets)

These benefits apply to **every widget** Clickeen makes. Inherit them, don't repeat them.

1. **Instant personalized localization (Ombra + multi-language)** - Give Ombra your website URL and watch it instantly personalize widget content to your business, then localize it across your workspace’s active locales (tier-based; up to 29). (Minibob demo: fast base-language preview; upsell signup for “all languages”.) Then edit with natural language—no manual field updates, no translator needed
2. **Templates OR pixel-perfect custom** - Pick a curated template OR define everything to the pixel exactly how you want it—your choice, total freedom
3. **Hyper-flexible styling** - Adapt to any design system, any brand, any aesthetic—extreme customization without breaking
4. **SEO/GEO optimized** - Code automatically optimized for every country, search engines, and geographic context

**Platform positioning:**
- vs. **Elfsight**: We give you instant personalized localization (website → active locales; up to 29) + templates OR pixel-perfect custom; they lock you into templates with manual editing
- vs. **Custom-built**: We give you Ombra (instant personalization + multi-language localization up to 29); they give you dev time and manual translation costs
- vs. **Native CMS plugins**: We give you instant global reach (personalized content in your active languages); they lock you into one platform with one language

## Widget-Specific Override

**Location:** `documentation/widgets/<Widget>/<Widget>_ContentStrategy.md`

**Contents:** Only Part 2 (widget benefits) and any widget-specific derivation rules.

```
