## 2025-02-10 — Dieter Lab Component Contracts Blocked
- **Context:** Lab `newcomponentsSept25.md` requires completing the backlog of components (Container → Pulsar) with Dieter-compliant CSS contracts, demos, docs, and tests.
- **Observation:** `documentation/systems/Dieter.md` (frozen v1) only defines Button and Segmented Control contracts. No normative guidance or tokens exist for other components.
- **Decision:** Halt CSS authoring for the remaining lab components until Dieter PRD is updated. Proceeding would violate the "no guessing" rule and risk divergence from Phase-1 specs.
- **Next steps:** Await updated Dieter documentation or explicit CEO approval defining each component's contract/tokens before resuming Steps 2–7 in the lab workflow.
