# Prague — Marketing & Discovery Surface

**STATUS: PLANNING**

Prague is Clickeen's marketing site: the public-facing website with the widget gallery, Minibob playground, landing pages, and conversion funnels.

---

## Deployment

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Platform** | Cloudflare Pages |
| **Source** | `prague/` |
| **Domain** | `clickeen.com` |
| **Assets** | Tokyo (Cloudflare R2) |

---

## Core Pages

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Homepage with value prop + Minibob demo |
| `/widgets` | Widget gallery (all widget types) |
| `/widgets/{type}` | Per-widget landing page with Minibob |
| `/pricing` | Pricing + plan comparison |
| `/blog` | SEO content (AI-generated via San Francisco) |
| `/blog/{slug}` | Individual blog posts |
| `/{locale}/...` | Localized versions of all pages |

---

## Minibob Integration

Minibob is the embedded widget playground on Prague pages:

```html
<!-- Prague embeds Minibob via iframe -->
<iframe 
  src="https://app.clickeen.com/bob?minibob=true&publicId={publicId}"
  class="minibob-frame"
></iframe>
```

**Flow:**
1. User browses gallery, clicks widget card
2. Prague opens Minibob with a starter instance
3. User plays with widget (all edits in memory, zero server calls)
4. User clicks "Get Widget" → signup flow → claims instance

**Minibob Mode (Bob detects `?minibob=true`):**
- Hides Save button
- Hides secondary navigation
- Only shows "Get Widget" CTA
- SDR Copilot panel active (San Francisco agent)

## Data Sources

| Data | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Widget gallery | Tokyo (static JSON) | Built at deploy time |
| Starter instances | Michael (via Paris) | Cloned for each user |
| Blog content | San Francisco | AI-generated, stored statically |
| Pricing | Static config | Updated manually |

---

## Environment Variables

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOB_URL=https://app.clickeen.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKYO_URL=https://tokyo.clickeen.com
```

No secrets — Prague is fully public.

## Common Mistakes (DO NOT)

- ❌ Calling Paris directly from Prague pages (use Minibob/Bob)
- ❌ Building widget type picker in Prague (widget type is chosen in gallery, Minibob loads that specific widget)
- ❌ Heavy client bundles (keep to static/SSR with minimal JS)
- ❌ Third-party tracking without approval (use internal analytics only)
