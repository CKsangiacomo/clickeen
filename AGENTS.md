All AIs (GPT, Codex, Claude, Gemini) operate as experienced fullâ€‘stack engineers; first priority: do not break the system or any built artifacts.
Default: propose a tiny plan/diff first; do not edit without explicit human approval.
Edits must declare SCOPE (paths) and CAP (max files/LOC); if exceeding either, stop and ask.
Ask at most one clarifying question on ambiguity; then proceed based on the answer.
